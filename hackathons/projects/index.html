              <h1>Emergency Hospital Locator</h1>
              <h4>Morgan Rose, Aaron Bauer, Hongbin Sun</h4>
              <p>A UI simplification on the process of searching for urgent care, this Locator would be a one tap stop for: finding the nearest hospital, giving you a route, contacting 911, and alerting loved ones. The goal is to simplify steps needed in an emergency situation; providing a crucial few seconds of advantage, and knowledge that one button is all you need to press to get help. Further, the application is accessible from the lock screen. So if someone is incapacitated, a bystander can perform all these functions for them without issue. Potentially saving a life, and definitely providing loved ones some crucial information regarding the status of their relative.</p>

              <h4>Lucasz Borowczak, Christian Lanzer, Aid Idrizovic, Nieky Allen</h4>
              <p>DrTxt is a Slackbot that was created to give users an interactive way to get helpful medical information about their current condition, and to give them next steps to take in order to help them get the help the treatment they need. It uses a web-scraper to grab information from the Mayo Clinic's database of diseases (for demonstration purposes). DrTxt is envisioned as a conversational bot that calms the user as it delivers information in a more personal way than the alternatives.</p>

              <p>An application to schedule appointments with health care providers AND review appointments with patients. This take on an appointment scheduler is fully functional. It supports password protected accounts for both patients requesting appointments and doctors making their time available to patients. There are many applications for such a quickly implemented system, especially for pro-bono time from doctors.</p>

              <p>A truly accessible counceling platform. Friendly is a forum. Designed with anonymity in mind. To provide mental health care without social pressures. Friendly envisions a platform where you can sign up, and chat in protected forums with healthcare professionals, avoiding "trolls" and creating a safe space. Potentially, friendly would like to allow people to video chat or communicate non-anonymously once they feel comfortable with their situation and their peers.</p>

              <h4>Tara Raj, Kate Schoenberger, Mary Makarious</h4>
              <p>There are applications that help you schedule medicines. There are also applications that warn of possible interactions between them. Medsapp is an apache cordova app that integrates both into a cross platform simplified view designed to make medicine a little safer. Can you take that aspirin? This app warns you when a medicine you are about to take interacts with a medicine's active ingredient that is still lingering in your body.</p>

              <p>A one stop shop for all things medical. Find a practicioner near you, call 911, learn about your symptoms, all from a single app with simple workflow. Many solutions provide these features individually, but it makes sense to have these related interests on a single platform such that they can interweave. Use medifast to find a practitioner who knows about your symptoms, a hospital that is well rated, and largely, to give users access to medical help - fast.</p>

            <h1>Loyola Hacks for Hunger</h1>
            <p>Hacked on 7 November 15</p>
            <p>LuTech's exercise in framing the issue of hunger through the lens of technology.
              We will come up with tangible proposals/prototypes at the event which will be discussed with the whole group. With Loyola Hacks for Hunger, Loyola students will come together to create real solutions to real problems that face people around the city and around the world every day. Through an interdisciplinary approach, Loyola Hacks for Hunger will be a fun, collaborative, constructive event.</p>

              <p>A web application designed to bring fun to both the process of learning to garden and grow food as well as learn to code. This project is aimed at creating a game that allows students to learn to grow their own potatoes while competing against their fellow students in other classes and even other schools in both the growing of their potato as well as coding challenges. When students achieve certain milestones in both their coding and their individual potato's growth, they will be rewarded with things like recipes named after local chefs who sponsor the cause and donate a recipe related to potatoes. The Great Potato Race is a fun, exciting and educational project to get involved in both sustainability and learning to code.</p>

              <p>FoodQ is a platform and system designed to address the issue of leftover food that many businesses have at the end of the day. The goal is to distribute the left over food to local organizations that give food to those experiencing hunger. FoodQ will not only just be a platform where vendors can list their leftovers, but it will also attempt to distribute the leftover food in the best and most efficient way possible. It may not be best to give 100 bagels to an organization that can only reasonably expect to use 50 before the product spoils. Likewise, FoodQ will attempt to direct fresh produce to organizations that are low on supplies in that area as well as direct baked goods to organizations in need of that particular resource at the time, etc. </p>

              <p>Food With Care is designed to tackle the issue of the immediate food needs of someone experiencing hunger. Food With Care will distribute physical kiosk stations where those without access to connected technology can find out where they can go in that moment to be fed. It will direct users to the nearest available community/soup kitchen or a local partner willing to provide a meal. The kiosk will also serve another purpose as an information station to those experiencing hunger and homelessness so that they can see what resources they have access to in both the short and long term.</p>

            <p>Hacked on 17 October 15</p>
            <p>LuTech's exercise in community-driven hacking. In collaboration with Loyola University Chicago's Institute of Environmental
              Sustainability, Loyola students came together to hack together prototype solutions to Chicago sustainability issues.
              Topics tackled included city biking, city walking, and building energy consumption. Participants used open city data to create real
              solutions for real problems in Chicago.</p>

              <p>A Java application calculates the best possible time for large buildings to transition from heating to cooling their facilities.
              Flip the Switch saves organizations money by checking years of past weather data, comparing it to contemporary forcasts, stripping out anomolous data to find the most responsible day to transition heating and air systems. Flip the Switch eliminates the guess work that often takes place when large buildings go through the costly process of transitioning heating and air systems, potentially limiting heating and cooling energy usage on a huge scale.</p>

              open city data of bike rack locations in Chicago to calculate and find the closest bike rack to a given location. BikeRack is a web-based solution that takes a simple calculation with interesting city data, and opens it up for use by anyone looking to make their daily commute more eco-friendly, check the bike-friendliness of a given neighborhood, or plan out a day's bike ride.</p>

Walk Chicago uses open zip-code boundary data to make discovering new areas in Chicago fun, presenting the user with a map of the city that remains blank until a zip-code has been walked into. Entire zip-codes pop into the user's map as they discover them, making discovering new parts of the city a gamified challenge. The Walk Chicago team set out to encourage shorter commutes to be walked, decongesting traffic and helping people rediscover the joys of walking around Chicago.</p>
